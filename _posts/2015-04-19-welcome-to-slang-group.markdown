Written language on the web is being shaped by two forces: the growing number of
participants from around the world adding their own voices, and the social and
technical limits of the web to support their languages.

<!--break-->

In most cases this is not malicious: languages are forgotten, localization and
internationalization are put aside for later, intricacies of database settings
go untaught and unremembered. As a programmer I know how difficult it is to
modify a monolingual website or app for many languages. Even building your app
from the start with these factors in mind takes a great deal of effort, especially
when you consider right-to-left support, multiple fonts, pluralization, names,
etc.

SLANG Group is an experimental reference for the multilingual web. Developers,
designers, and interested learners should be able to look up their favorite tools
and find a reference and best practices to maximize language support. What data type
should I use in MySQL? How do I render map tiles in Cherokee script? Piece by piece, the
multilingual web can be collected here.

If this experiment takes off, I will start outreach to developers of major open
source projects (Bootstrap, Angular, Rails, Postgres) to make tutorials. I'm
hoping to do a crowdfunding project around this in the near future.

Until then, the best way you can help is [writing an article](https://github.com/slang-group/slang-group.github.io)
or [requesting a topic](https://github.com/slang-group/slang-group.github.io).
