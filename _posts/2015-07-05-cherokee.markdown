The Cherokee language has its own syllabary characters, which are included in Unicode.

## Fonts

Many Windows and Mac machines ship with a Cherokee font named Plantagenet, but it <a href="http://www.languagegeek.com/rotinonhsonni/tsalagi/do.html">displays the character ·èô as it appeared historically</a>. This is "upside-down" from how it should appear in modern Cherokee text. iOS includes a Cherokee font, but Android does not.

Consider using a web font, either from Google Noto or Digohweli from the Cherokee Nation, for a
unified experience on all devices.
