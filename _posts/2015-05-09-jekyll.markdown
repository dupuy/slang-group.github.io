Jekyll does not come with any internationalization tools. You will need to install a plugin.

The most popular, currently-maintained plugin is the [Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin](https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin).

It is an open source program with the Mozilla Public License.

## Installing

In your project directory, run this command:

```git submodule add git://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin.git _plugins/multiple-languages```
