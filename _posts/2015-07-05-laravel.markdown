PHP's Laravel framework comes with a [localization package](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/localization) which supports translations and
plurals.

Marc CÃ¡mara produces [laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization),
a popular tool to assist with translations. It supports Laravel versions 4.0 and higher.
