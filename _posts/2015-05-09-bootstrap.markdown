Bootstrap is a CSS and JS framework which was originally developed by Twitter.

## Bootstrap-Noto

SLANG Group produces a multilingual library called "Bootstrap Noto".
By setting the standard font to Google Noto, text has similar size and weight
across different languages and scripts.

You can make use of the GitHub Pages CDN and include Bootstrap-Noto in your HTML like this:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://slang-group.github.io/bootstrap-noto/dist/bootstrap-noto.min.css"/>
```

You could also download that CSS file and host it yourself.
