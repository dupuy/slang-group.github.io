Myanmar (Burmese) has its own script and is Unicode-supported.

Many people use a non-Unicode-compliant font called Zawgyi to enter data into systems.
Fortunately, there are several scripts to detect and convert Zawgyi text into Unicode.

## Open Fonts

This Google Code page contains several fonts including both Unicode-compatible and Zawgyi
Myanmar text.

Google Noto contains a font for Unicode-compatible Myanmar text.

## Checking accuracy

Some diacritics appear on the left of the character that they modify. You should see the capital of Myanmar, နေပြည်တော် start with a diacritic ေ which looks like the number 6. It should not place the န first.

## Detecting non-Unicode input

The knayi-myscript module for NodeJS can detect most Zawgyi text.

The knayi-cli command line tool, based on knayi-myscript and NodeJS, can be used to convert
Zawgyi text to Unicode. Any Unicode-compatible text is left unchanged.

## Converting to and from Unicode

There are solutions available to convert between the two text formats in many different languages.

**NodeJS**

**PHP**
