Marshallese has its own alphabet, which includes most ASCII letters, and adds on
two types of diacritics or accents: a flat bar above some letters, and a comma below
some letters.

## Key mapping

In the Marshall Islands, many residents use a non-Unicode-compliant font to replace
letters uncommon in Marshallese (such as X) with accented Marshallese letters.

Use jQuery.IME or the key-map inside jQuery.IME to convert Marshallese input into
Unicode text.

## Future

The Unicode Consortium has discussed creating codepoints for Marshallese letters
which have a comma underneath them. Currently Marshallese text uses a similar but
different letter in the Latvian language block.
