In right-to-left languages, users expect page content to be flipped (a nav which appears on the left edge of an English-language website, would organizationally make more sense on the right edge of an Arabic-language website)

[bi-app](https://github.com/anasnakawa/bi-app-less) is an open source LESS library which receives common directional properties in CSS and returns two files: one for left-to-right languages, and the other for right-to-left.
