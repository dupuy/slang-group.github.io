Modern Korean writing consists of several dozen *hangul* characters,
as well as thousands of *kanji* characters.

## CJK characters and fonts

When using CJK characters (Chinese, Japanese, or Korean) it is important to use a
Korean font. The same character will appear slightly differently in each language.

North Korea is believed to use a separate text encoding. Although they have applied
to have it supported by Unicode, they have not been successful.
