Myanmar (Burmese) has its own script and is Unicode-supported.

Many people use a non-Unicode-compliant font called Zawgyi to enter data into systems.
Fortunately, there are several scripts to detect and convert Zawgyi text into Unicode.

Some diacritics appear on the left of the character that they modify. You should see the capital of Myanmar, နေပြည်တော် start with a diacritic ေ which looks like the number 6. It should not place the န first.
