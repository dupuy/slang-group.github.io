Cherokee has its own syllabary, which is included in Unicode.

## Fonts

Windows machines ship with a Cherokee font, but it displays the
__ character upside-down. iOS includes a Cherokee font, but Android does not.

Consider using a web font, either from Google Noto or the Cherokee Nation, for a
unified experience on all devices.
