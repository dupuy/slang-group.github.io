[React Intl](http://formatjs.io/react/) is a component for translating React apps for the web.

[React Native currently uses a different core](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/issues/119) and cannot support React Intl. Use [React Native Localization](https://github.com/stefalda/ReactNativeLocalization) from Stefano Falda, or
[React Native i18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n) from Alexander
Zaytsev.

## Install

Install React Intl using npm:

<code>npm install react-intl</code>

## Usage

Plurals and other features are described [on the project page](http://formatjs.io/react/).
